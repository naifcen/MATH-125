            { q: "What is the key difference between a population and a sample?", a: "A population is the entire group of interest, while a sample is a subset of that population." },
            { q: "A measurable characteristic of a population is called a ______, and it's denoted by ______ letters.", a: "Parameter, Greek (e.g., μ, σ)." },
            { q: "A measurable characteristic of a sample is called a ______, and it's denoted by ______ letters.", a: "Statistic, Latin (e.g., x̄, s)." },

            { q: "Which measure of center is NOT resistant to outliers?", a: "The Mean (x̄)." },
            { q: "In a right-skewed distribution, would you expect the mean to be greater or less than the median?", a: "Greater than the median. The mean is pulled toward the long tail." },
            { q: "What is the formula for the location of the median?", a: "The (n+1)/2 position in the ordered data." },
            { q: "If a dataset has an ODD number of observations, how do you find the median?", a: "It is the single middle number in the ordered list." },

            { q: "How do you find Q₁ and Q₃ if 'n' is ODD?", a: "Find the median of the lower half and upper half of the data, EXCLUDING the overall median from both halves." },
            { q: "How do you find Q₁ and Q₃ if 'n' is EVEN?", a: "Find the median of the entire lower half and the entire upper half of the data." },
            { q: "What is the name for the summary that includes the Minimum, Q₁, Median, Q₃, and Maximum?", a: "The Five-Number Summary." },
            { q: "What is the rule of thumb for identifying suspected outliers?", a: "The 1.5 x IQR Rule. An observation is an outlier if it's below Q₁ - (1.5 * IQR) or above Q₃ + (1.5 * IQR)." },
            { q: "Which measures of center and spread should you use for a skewed distribution?", a: "The five-number summary (Median and IQR) because they are resistant." },
            { q: "What is the symbol for a sample mean, and what is its common name?", a: "x̄, pronounced 'x-bar'." },
            { q: "What is the symbol for a population mean?", a: "μ (the Greek letter mu)." },
            { q: "What does the symbol Σ (Sigma) mean in a formula?", a: "It means to sum up, or add all the values." }
